        content: "<h3>What Is an Equation?</h3><p>An equation is simply a math sentence that says two things are equal. When we see the symbol $=$, it means \"the left side has the same value as the right side.\" A <strong>linear equation</strong> is one where the variable (usually $x$) is raised only to the first power &mdash; no $x^2$, no $x^3$, just plain $x$.</p><p>Your one goal when solving an equation: <strong>get the variable completely alone on one side</strong>. We do this by performing \"inverse operations\" &mdash; basically, undoing whatever has been done to the variable.</p><h3>One-Step Equations</h3><p>These are the simplest equations. Only one operation stands between you and the answer.</p><div class=\"lesson-formula\">If $x + a = b$, then $x = b - a$ (subtract $a$ from both sides)</div><div class=\"lesson-formula\">If $x - a = b$, then $x = b + a$ (add $a$ to both sides)</div><div class=\"lesson-formula\">If $ax = b$, then $x = \\frac{b}{a}$ (divide both sides by $a$)</div><div class=\"lesson-formula\">If $\\frac{x}{a} = b$, then $x = ab$ (multiply both sides by $a$)</div><div class=\"lesson-example\"><div class=\"lesson-example-label\">Example 1</div><p><strong>Problem:</strong> Solve $x + 7 = 15$</p><p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><div class=\"explanation-text\"><div class=\"step\">Step 1: We need to get $x$ alone. Right now, 7 is being added to $x$.</div><div class=\"step\">Step 2: The opposite of adding 7 is subtracting 7. Subtract 7 from BOTH sides:</div><div class=\"step\">$x + 7 - 7 = 15 - 7$</div><div class=\"step\">$x = 8$</div><div class=\"step\">Step 3: Check &mdash; plug it back in: $8 + 7 = 15$ &#10003;</div></div></div><h3>Two-Step Equations</h3><p>These require two operations to isolate $x$. The golden rule: <strong>undo addition/subtraction first, then undo multiplication/division</strong>. Think of it like peeling off layers &mdash; start with the outer layer.</p><div class=\"lesson-example\"><div class=\"lesson-example-label\">Example 2</div><p><strong>Problem:</strong> Solve $3x - 5 = 16$</p><p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><div class=\"explanation-text\"><div class=\"step\">Step 1: First, undo the subtraction. Add 5 to both sides: $3x - 5 + 5 = 16 + 5$</div><div class=\"step\">$3x = 21$</div><div class=\"step\">Step 2: Now undo the multiplication. Divide both sides by 3: $\\frac{3x}{3} = \\frac{21}{3}$</div><div class=\"step\">$x = 7$</div><div class=\"step\">Step 3: Check: $3(7) - 5 = 21 - 5 = 16$ &#10003;</div></div></div><h3>Multi-Step Equations</h3><p>Sometimes you need to simplify before you can isolate the variable. The two big tools here are:</p><ul><li><strong>Distributing:</strong> $a(b + c) = ab + ac$ &mdash; multiply the outside number by each term inside the parentheses</li><li><strong>Combining like terms:</strong> $3x + 5x = 8x$ &mdash; add or subtract terms that have the same variable part</li></ul><div class=\"lesson-example\"><div class=\"lesson-example-label\">Example 3</div><p><strong>Problem:</strong> Solve $2(x + 4) - 3 = 15$</p><p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><div class=\"explanation-text\"><div class=\"step\">Step 1: Distribute the 2: $2 \\cdot x + 2 \\cdot 4 - 3 = 15$ which gives $2x + 8 - 3 = 15$</div><div class=\"step\">Step 2: Combine like terms on the left: $2x + 5 = 15$</div><div class=\"step\">Step 3: Subtract 5 from both sides: $2x = 10$</div><div class=\"step\">Step 4: Divide both sides by 2: $x = 5$</div><div class=\"step\">Check: $2(5 + 4) - 3 = 2(9) - 3 = 18 - 3 = 15$ &#10003;</div></div></div><h3>Equations with Fractions</h3><p>Fractions make equations look scary, but here is the trick: <strong>multiply every term by the least common denominator (LCD) to eliminate all fractions at once</strong>.</p><div class=\"lesson-example\"><div class=\"lesson-example-label\">Example 4</div><p><strong>Problem:</strong> Solve $\\frac{x}{3} + \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{5}{6}$</p><p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><div class=\"explanation-text\"><div class=\"step\">Step 1: The denominators are 3, 2, and 6. The LCD is 6.</div><div class=\"step\">Step 2: Multiply every term by 6: $6 \\cdot \\frac{x}{3} + 6 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = 6 \\cdot \\frac{5}{6}$</div><div class=\"step\">$2x + 3 = 5$</div><div class=\"step\">Step 3: Subtract 3: $2x = 2$</div><div class=\"step\">Step 4: Divide by 2: $x = 1$</div></div></div><h3>Variables on Both Sides</h3><p>When the variable appears on both sides of the equation, your first job is to <strong>move all variable terms to one side and all number terms to the other side</strong>.</p><div class=\"lesson-example\"><div class=\"lesson-example-label\">Example 5</div><p><strong>Problem:</strong> Solve $5x + 3 = 2x + 18$</p><p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><div class=\"explanation-text\"><div class=\"step\">Step 1: Subtract $2x$ from both sides to group the $x$ terms: $5x - 2x + 3 = 18$, so $3x + 3 = 18$</div><div class=\"step\">Step 2: Subtract 3 from both sides: $3x = 15$</div><div class=\"step\">Step 3: Divide by 3: $x = 5$</div><div class=\"step\">Check: Left side: $5(5) + 3 = 28$. Right side: $2(5) + 18 = 28$ &#10003;</div></div></div><h3>Creating Equations from Word Problems</h3><p>The SAT loves to describe a situation in words and ask you to write an equation. Here is the strategy:</p><ul><li>Read the problem carefully and identify what the unknown is &mdash; call it $x$</li><li>Translate English into math: \"is\" means $=$, \"more than\" means $+$, \"less than\" means $-$, \"times\" or \"of\" means $\\times$</li><li>Write the equation, then solve</li></ul><div class=\"lesson-example\"><div class=\"lesson-example-label\">Example 6</div><p><strong>Problem:</strong> A gym charges a one-time registration fee of $\\$25$ plus $\\$40$ per month. If Maria has spent $\\$225$ total, how many months has she been a member?</p><p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><div class=\"explanation-text\"><div class=\"step\">Step 1: Let $m$ = number of months.</div><div class=\"step\">Step 2: Total cost = registration fee + monthly cost, so: $25 + 40m = 225$</div><div class=\"step\">Step 3: Subtract 25: $40m = 200$</div><div class=\"step\">Step 4: Divide by 40: $m = 5$ months</div></div></div><div class=\"lesson-key-point\"><strong>SAT Tip:</strong> On the Digital SAT, about 35% of math questions involve algebra. Many of the equation questions can be solved in under a minute once you master these steps. Always check your answer by plugging it back into the original equation!</div><div class=\"lesson-key-point\"><strong>Common Trap:</strong> When distributing a negative sign, be careful: $-(3x - 7) = -3x + 7$, NOT $-3x - 7$. Forgetting to flip the sign on the second term is one of the most common mistakes on the SAT.</div>",

        content: "<h3>What Is a Linear Function?</h3><p>A <strong>linear function</strong> is any equation whose graph makes a straight line. The most common form is <strong>slope-intercept form</strong>:</p><div class=\"lesson-formula\">$y = mx + b$</div><p>In this form:</p><ul><li>$m$ is the <strong>slope</strong> (how steep the line is and in which direction it tilts)</li><li>$b$ is the <strong>y-intercept</strong> (where the line crosses the vertical axis)</li></ul><h3>Understanding Slope</h3><p>Slope measures how much the line goes up or down as you move from left to right. Think of it as \"rise over run.\"</p><div class=\"lesson-formula\">$m = \\frac{\\text{rise}}{\\text{run}} = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}$</div><ul><li><strong>Positive slope</strong> ($m > 0$): line goes UP from left to right</li><li><strong>Negative slope</strong> ($m < 0$): line goes DOWN from left to right</li><li><strong>Zero slope</strong> ($m = 0$): line is perfectly horizontal</li><li><strong>Undefined slope</strong>: line is perfectly vertical (not a function)</li></ul><div class=\"lesson-example\"><div class=\"lesson-example-label\">Example 1</div><p><strong>Problem:</strong> Find the slope of the line passing through $(2, 3)$ and $(6, 11)$.</p><p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><div class=\"explanation-text\"><div class=\"step\">Step 1: Label the points: $(x_1, y_1) = (2, 3)$ and $(x_2, y_2) = (6, 11)$</div><div class=\"step\">Step 2: Use the slope formula: $m = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} = \\frac{11 - 3}{6 - 2} = \\frac{8}{4} = 2$</div><div class=\"step\">The slope is 2, meaning the line rises 2 units for every 1 unit it moves to the right.</div></div></div><h3>Interpreting Slope and Y-Intercept in Context</h3><p>On the SAT, you will often be given a linear equation that models a real-world situation. The slope and y-intercept have real meanings:</p><ul><li><strong>Slope = rate of change.</strong> It tells you how much $y$ changes each time $x$ increases by 1.</li><li><strong>Y-intercept = starting value.</strong> It is the value of $y$ when $x = 0$ (the beginning).</li></ul><div class=\"lesson-example\"><div class=\"lesson-example-label\">Example 2</div><p><strong>Problem:</strong> The equation $C = 0.15m + 35$ models the monthly cost $C$ (in dollars) of a phone plan where $m$ is the number of text messages sent. What does the number 0.15 represent?</p><p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><div class=\"explanation-text\"><div class=\"step\">The equation is in the form $y = mx + b$ where $m = 0.15$ and $b = 35$.</div><div class=\"step\">The slope $0.15$ is the rate of change &mdash; it means each additional text message costs $\\$0.15$.</div><div class=\"step\">The y-intercept $35$ is the starting cost &mdash; the base monthly fee before any texts are sent.</div></div></div><h3>Writing the Equation of a Line</h3><p>If you know the slope $m$ and a point $(x_1, y_1)$, you can write the equation using <strong>point-slope form</strong>:</p><div class=\"lesson-formula\">$y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)$</div><p>Then distribute and rearrange to get slope-intercept form if needed.</p><div class=\"lesson-example\"><div class=\"lesson-example-label\">Example 3</div><p><strong>Problem:</strong> Write the equation of a line with slope $-3$ that passes through $(2, 5)$.</p><p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><div class=\"explanation-text\"><div class=\"step\">Step 1: Use point-slope form: $y - 5 = -3(x - 2)$</div><div class=\"step\">Step 2: Distribute: $y - 5 = -3x + 6$</div><div class=\"step\">Step 3: Add 5 to both sides: $y = -3x + 11$</div></div></div><h3>Parallel and Perpendicular Lines</h3><p>This is a favorite SAT topic. The rules are simple:</p><div class=\"lesson-key-point\"><strong>Key Point</strong><ul><li><strong>Parallel lines</strong> have the SAME slope. If one line has slope $m = 2$, any parallel line also has slope $2$.</li><li><strong>Perpendicular lines</strong> have slopes that are <strong>negative reciprocals</strong>. If one line has slope $\\frac{2}{3}$, the perpendicular line has slope $-\\frac{3}{2}$.</li></ul></div><div class=\"lesson-example\"><div class=\"lesson-example-label\">Example 4</div><p><strong>Problem:</strong> Line $A$ has equation $y = \\frac{1}{4}x - 3$. What is the slope of a line perpendicular to Line $A$?</p><p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><div class=\"explanation-text\"><div class=\"step\">Line $A$ has slope $m = \\frac{1}{4}$.</div><div class=\"step\">The negative reciprocal of $\\frac{1}{4}$ is $-\\frac{4}{1} = -4$.</div><div class=\"step\">The perpendicular line has slope $-4$.</div></div></div><div class=\"lesson-key-point\"><strong>SAT Tip:</strong> When a question asks for the equation of a line from a graph, identify two clear points on the line, compute the slope, then read the y-intercept from where the line crosses the y-axis. That gives you $m$ and $b$ for $y = mx + b$.</div><div class=\"lesson-key-point\"><strong>Common Trap:</strong> When the equation is not in slope-intercept form, students misidentify the slope. For example, in $2y = 6x + 10$, the slope is NOT 6. You must first divide everything by 2 to get $y = 3x + 5$, so the slope is 3.</div>",

The key is to identify the correct \"group\" (row, column, or total) to use as your denominator.</p><div class=\"lesson-example\"><div class=\"lesson-example-label\">Example 2</div><p><strong>Problem:</strong> In a survey, 120 students were asked if they prefer cats or dogs.

There are three main ratios:</p><div class=\"lesson-formula\">$\\sin(\\theta) = \\frac{\\text{Opposite}}{\\text{Hypotenuse}}$ (SOH)</div><div class=\"lesson-formula\">$\\cos(\\theta) = \\frac{\\text{Adjacent}}{\\text{Hypotenuse}}$ (CAH)</div><div class=\"lesson-formula\">$\\tan(\\theta) = \\frac{\\text{Opposite}}{\\text{Adjacent}}$ (TOA)</div><p>\"Opposite\" means the side across from the angle you are looking at. \"Adjacent\" means the side next to the angle (that is not the hypotenuse). The <strong>hypotenuse</strong> is always the longest side, opposite the right angle.</p><div class=\"lesson-example\"><div class=\"lesson-example-label\">Example 5</div><p><strong>Problem:</strong> In a right triangle, the side opposite angle $A$ is 5 and the hypotenuse is 13.

This means the sine of an angle equals the cosine of its complement.</p><h3>Absolute Value Equations</h3><p>The <strong>absolute value</strong> of a number is its distance from zero on the number line. It is always positive (or zero).</p><div class=\"lesson-formula\">$|x| = x$ if $x \\geq 0$, and $|x| = -x$ if $x < 0$</div><p>To solve an absolute value equation like $|ax + b| = c$:</p><ul><li>Set up two equations: $ax + b = c$ AND $ax + b = -c$</li><li>Solve both equations</li><li>Check both solutions in the original equation</li></ul><div class=\"lesson-example\"><div class=\"lesson-example-label\">Example 6</div><p><strong>Problem:</strong> Solve $|2x - 3| = 7$</p><p><strong>Solution:</strong></p><div class=\"explanation-text\"><div class=\"step\">Case 1: $2x - 3 = 7$, so $2x = 10$, so $x = 5$</div><div class=\"step\">Case 2: $2x - 3 = -7$, so $2x = -4$, so $x = -2$</div><div class=\"step\">Check: $|2(5) - 3| = |7| = 7$ &#10003; and $|2(-2) - 3| = |-7| = 7$ &#10003;</div><div class=\"step\">Both solutions are valid: $x = 5$ or $x = -2$</div></div></div><div class=\"lesson-key-point\"><strong>SAT Tip:</strong> For exponential growth/decay questions, the SAT often provides the equation and asks you to interpret what the numbers mean. The base (the number being raised to a power) tells you the growth or decay factor. If it is greater than 1, it is growth. If it is between 0 and 1, it is decay.</div><div class=\"lesson-key-point\"><strong>Common Trap:</strong> When solving absolute value equations, remember that $|x| = -5$ has NO solution, because absolute value cannot be negative. Also, always check your solutions, because some may be extraneous.</div>",
